# cv
The code to generate my CV

./build.sh can be used to produce the output PDF locally, assuming that both Inkscape and pdftk are installed.

A better way is to use the provided action that rebuilds the PDF after every push to the repository. The resulting CV file is "goryunov_cv.pdf" in the root of the repository.

Different branches contain alternative variants of the CV.
