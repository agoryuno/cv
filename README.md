# cv

The code to generate my CV.

**Download the PDF**: [goryunov_cv.pdf](https://github.com/agoryuno/cv/raw/tech_variant/goryunov_cv.pdf)

# Description

This uses SVG and Jinja2 templates to compile a finished PDF.

./build.sh can be used to produce the output PDF locally, assuming that both Inkscape and pdftk are installed.

A compiled PDF file (**goryunov_cv.pdf**) with the CV is output automatically by a Github Workflow on every 
push to the repository.
