# cv

The code to generate my CV.

This uses SVG and Jinja2 templates to compile a finished PDF.

./build.sh can be used to produce the output PDF locally, assuming that both Inkscape and pdftk are installed.

A compiled PDF file (**goryunov_cv.pdf**) with the CV is output automatically by a Github Workflow on every 
push to the repository.
