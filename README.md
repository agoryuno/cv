# cv

The code to generate my CV

./build.sh can be used to produce the output PDF locally, assuming that both Inkscape and pdftk are installed.

A better way is to use the provided action that rebuilds the PDF after every push to the repository. There should be an artifact with the zipped PDF on the most recent workflow run.

Different branches contain alternative variants of the CV.
